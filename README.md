# Algorithm Visualiser ✨
***A graphical visualisation of advanced data structures and algorithms.***

## Page Layout 🗺
* [x] Initial data and containers organised.
* [x] Holy Grail Grid layout formatted.
* [x] Page styling added, centering header elements inline with flex containers.
* [x] Device Boundaries and Scaling formatted suitable for desktop and tablet/mobile proportions.

## Display Array 🔮
* [x] Dynamically add div boxes based on array size.
* [x] Set index width and height properties according to viewport size.
* [ ] Center array container and anchor to bottom of page.
* [x] Colour visiting and completed index boxes to visualise swapping.
* [ ] Adjust each Div Element as the window is adjusted.
* [ ] Format Timer label at bottom of page to represent alg time complexity.

## Sorting Handler 🧙
* [x] Implement update methods for switching index values and adjusting div heights based on value.
* [x] Highlight divs on visiting each index for comparison and when they are locked in order.
* [ ] Develop Sorting Methods!



## BUGS! 🐞
* [x] Algorithm completes as the Animation Timer is paused.
* [x] Deactivate input buttons to prevent multiple async sorts from occuring.
* [ ] Div Values are erroneous when the dataset is adjusted by anything less than before.
